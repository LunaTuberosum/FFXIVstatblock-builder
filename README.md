# FFXIV TTRPG Stat Block Builder
### By: Luna Tuberosum


Welcome to the program version of the stat block creator. With this using a simple program you can make, customize, and save stat cards to be used in your next FFXIV TTRPG session. You can also export them as a PNG to send to friends.


Within this program there is an example stat sheet (collection of stat cards). This is there to help you understand what is all capable with this program and let you have an easy play ground to learn.


The example stat sheet is based of the ***Minstrel's Ballad: Lord of the Corpse Hall*** by TheVagueOne on the FFXIV TTRPG Discord.


If you have any problems please message me on Discord. If you run into a bug please file a report here:

### **!! WARNING !!**
This current version **(0.91)** it has all the features necessary to make a stat card but it's lacking quite a lot of polish and quality of life features. This is mostly due to me taking a lot longer on this than I wanted to and would rather get it out for testing and use reason than hold it off another month or so to add the polish. So the 1.0 update will add these features. So fair warning there will be a lot of jank and bugs but please report it all
